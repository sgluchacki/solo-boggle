# Solo Boggle
A browser-based 1-player version of Boggle, produced after two weeks of learning code

## What is This Game?
In this game you'll compete against the clock (and the powers of an RNG-based board) to see how many words you can find on a 4 by 4 grid of letters. Typically, Boggle is played as a competitive game against 1 or more opponents. Here, you are the only thing that can beat yourself. 

## How do I Play?
Once you start the game, you will have (maybe) 5 minutes to search for words. To locate a word click on the first letter, then the next letter of the word can be any of the neighboring tiles (left, right, up, down, or diagonal). Once you use a letter it cannot be used again in building that word. Every word you find yields points as follows:

- 1 or 2 letters – 0 points
- 3 or 4 letters – 1 point
- 5 letters – 2 points
- 6 letters – 3 points
- 7 letters – 5 points
- 8 or more letters – 11 points

Please note that the Qu tile counts as two letters.

## Screenshot(s)
I'll put some screenshots here. I just have to, ummm...., build it first. In the meanwhile, here's the wireframe!

## Technologies Used

This project was constructed using HTML, CSS, JavaScript with jQuery, and maybe a little PhotoShop magic.

## Getting Started

This will be a link; you will be able to click on it. When you get to the landing page there will probably be a 'Start Game' button, or something similar. Click on that and follow the instructions from the [How do I Play?](#How do I play) section above.

## Next Steps

Multiplayer would be great; I'd love to create a browser-based competitive version of this. Maybe I'll get around to this. High scores, player rankings (and logins), and more may be available in the long term.

On another note, it might be doable to all keyboard-based inputs during the creation of this project.
